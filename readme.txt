Python 3.7.0 was used to execute this program. This program is best run in an IDE (e.g. PyCharm, Spyder).

Alternatively, you can run the program, enter the following in the Mac/Linux Terminal and/or Windows Powershell:

	python3 main.py

If you do not/cannot have python installed, please contact me and I would be more than happy to provide a live/recorded demo.
